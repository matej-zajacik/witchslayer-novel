# Ravel Road

Been raining for two days. Exactly as long as I'd been on my way. The bitter cold of the bleak weather pierced my coat, sawed right under my skin.

I must have been getting near. I hoped I was getting near.

My shoes were about to come apart, last ounce of bread eaten hours ago, and the dusk was imminent. I slowly dragged my tired feet ahead, shovelling mud out of the ground.

Yeah, I was getting near. This was definitely the road to Starham. Just as the cartman described it, when he dropped me at the Ravel's Crossroad.

Grass track bordered by stone causeways the height of my hips. Well, grass track... More like a tiny trail, here and there popping out of the sea of mud. And beyond the dikes, leafless trees, seemingly dead.

A big black raven took a seat on a limb. Large, black, empty eyes, strangely alive. Staring at me. Calm. Stoic. Not even fifteen feet from me. However I moved, whatever I did, the bird didn't even flinch. Been following me for an hour or so.

If you, little motherfucker, expect me to nick my yapper into the ground on this miserable joke of a road, and leave my body to your beastly appetite, you got it all wrong, fella!

My father and I... Let me rephrase that. My good old father and I, we'd been through a lot together on our journeys. On his journeys, more or less. He was one famous dude. And I was to fill his shoes now that he was old and tired. And retired.

When you get tired a lot, means you get re-tired. You get that, right?

You don't. Whatever.

Talking to myself'd been my favourite sport as of late. Having forgotten about the bird, I kept walking in the mud. Towards the famed town of Starham, birthplace to my mother Lora. And recently, her burial ground as well.

She died a few weeks ago. Holy fire burnt through her like through a moulder log. And I wasn't there. My father had sent me to Warewell to deal with a certain matter.

<!-- I went there to purchase ether for our guild. -->

She had been sickly and suffered for far too long before breathing her last. For that, I was glad she'd passed away, ending her misery. There was no cure. Nothing we could do.

And I wasn't there. And I even missed the funeral in the town! It was her will to be buried at her birthplace. My ancestors had always been buried in the family tomb on Rike Estates. All of the oldsters of yore rested there, down in the cold catacombs. Not Lora. `Lora tu neni pochovana, ale Marcus to vie odkial? Respektive nech tu teda neni pochovana, ale treba to spomenut v tychto blabotoch kdesi, ze ju previezli do Starhamu.` I mean, mother...

My feelings were mixed when they told me. Strangely, relief prevailed over grief.

Lora was cold towards us, as if her feelings and emotions had died away a long time ago. I think she must have been warm and jolly once, but as time went on, it was getting worse. Sometimes, I felt uneasy in her presence, especially when she sat in her black chair, silent and motionless for hours.

And sometimes, she stared at me. Not a stern glare of a parent who cares for their son, wanting the best for him. Rather an eerie, menacing stare, as chilling as death. One you can get in a dark alley from a stranger, when both of you are scared shitless by one another, and you put on the cold, unpiercable mask of pretension. To give one another the assumption that, "Hey, you are the prey and I'm the hunter here!" We all do it. You never know who you pass by in the night.

But my mother's intentions, reasons... Can't explain it, really. When father was away, I rather mostly avoided her altoghether. And then, at times, she was fine, caring, motherly. But that was rare.

We never found a way to connect. Not as a mother and a son. I could hardly make myself call her "mother" instead of her name. But still, I planned to visit the gravestone when I would arrive in Starham. At least say my farewell to her. She took care of me and my siblings as was expected of her.

I was thinking about her and my family and kept walking. Until I saw a man. Lying by the road, in the grass, leaning on a wooden hedge. I came closer.

The poor guy, an aged fellow from the looks, was wounded. Heavily. Dark red blood leaking from beneath his back mixed with the muddy rainwater, forming a nice cocktail for my birdfriend that's bound to be somewhere close by.

Me:: Hey, mister, uhm...

I was just about to ask if he's all right, but then I realized how freaking savvy that would be. But before I could make my mind on what to actually ask, he turned his pale face to me.

Man:: Get out of here, kid! Go back to whatever shithole you came from! This place is doomed!

Kinda surprised how much he was able to yap out while bleeding like a patsy.

Me:: What happened?

I was as polite as possible, fearing the question would sound idiotic. Fearing such things in such situations, that's, my friend, called big-ass major self-control.

The man preached.

Man:: The town is overrun with hell spawn! The gods' retribution came upon us all! Save yourself and run!

Me:: And miss all the fun? No, thank you!

I spat that out before even realizing how childish and impious that was. But seriously, dealing with demon spawn was exactly why I came. I'm Marcus Rike. From the famous House Rike. Well, maybe let's not get overexcited about my lineage. It's not as bright as I often make it to be.

Not sure if offended by my arrogance, or because of the blood shortage in his system, the man suddenly faded out. His head slid down with no vim in it, muttering something between his freezing lips.

With nothing much to do for this dude, as woeful as it is, I left him to his fate. At least he was gonna die in the rain, during sunset. That's the most appropriate setting for that kind of activity.

As I walked away, I turned my head back once more, and strangely enough, the raven did not stop by to have a snack. He just followed me.

# Strange Presence

The road turned. In the distance, I saw silhouettes of houses. As I sharpened my sight into the mile that separated me from the town, pleasing my heart with a vision of a warm bath, with blurred cuddly yellow lantern lights reinforcing this image, I sensed a presence of something.

Something quite close. Too close for my comfort. I tilted my eyes down and there it was. A dog! Feasting on a dead body that used to be a human just moments ago. Apparently, the poor animal hadn't eaten in days.

And I should have been a whole freaking lot more observant, never to drop my guard like that again!

Observing the dog for a minute, one would get to like it, as it grunted and smacked, happy in its own right. That is, if one could speak doggish.

Then it suddenly pulled its jaws from the carcass and sniffed the air. A jolt stormed through my chest. I could see it in its full glory now. It was no ordinary dog! Ribs sticking out, rotting flesh around the belly, and a fiery glow in its eyes. What the hell are you, buddy? Or rather, which hell are you from?

Seems the preacher wasn't delirious after all.

Watching the beast with a scholastic eye for a bit longer, I was beginning to believe I knew what it was. I'd studied all kinds of creatures and phenomenons recorded in the family's books all my life. Under the strict supervision of my father, needless to say. And according to my studies, pedantic as ever, the doggie in front of me was known as *kin*. A vicious beast. Especially when it surprises you out of nowhere.

To my relief, the kin didn't notice me. I noticed him first. So no rude surprises to endure. To my dis-relief, there was no other way around. I had to go right through his territory. But, there was no gear on me. No weapons, no essences, potions, no nothing.

Father was really itchy about letting me go alone with all the fancy equipment. See? No problemo if I fight demons with bare hands, right? But damn, dare anything happen to that expensive stuff!

He just didn't trust me enough. Don't know how it's any different from questing together, but he had this way of patronizing me when I was to make my own choice. Like I couldn't ever do well on my own. My choices were stupid, his were wise. That sort of thing.

Well, that's how he played it out. But I knew he just followed the family tradition. Every Rike on his first solo contract was to go through a baptism of fire. Means you get nothing. Not even a shiv. Gotta scrabble up anything necessary to finish the job yourself. And mind you, it's not always even clear right away what exactly that job is!

This is to put the years of training and upbringing to test. Physical fitness, combat skills, knowledge of lore. All of what you've learned, what you are. Can you somehow get to weapons? Do you remember how to prepare all the blade-enhancing essences and life-saving potions? And most importantly, can you bang a coin out of it? Can you succeed against all odds?

And what's on the line? Your neck and the prestige of the school or house you represent. Fathers know that as well. And yet they risk it all. Chaff must be severed from grain. Let me tell you, our profession is no picnic. It's killing business. Lives end. Limbs fall. That's how it is. And I'm sure I'll do the same to my son.

<!-- Every Rike on his first solo mission was to go through a baptism of fire. my father forbade taking anything with me but food. Not even a shiv. I had to scrabble up anything necessary to finish the job myself. And mind you, it was not even clear yet what exactly that job was! -->

<!-- Before taking pros and cons into consideration,  -->

Before venturing deeper into the trepidations of a demon-hunter's life, I grabbed a thick bough lying in the mud, and with a warcry worth a Rike, I charged the beast. That's how my old man always did it. If violence is inevitable, don't hesitate, don't think, just do it.

The startled dog leaped away at first, but after the initial shock, it returned to defend its kill. Or, as it seems, rather make a new one! I shouted, menaced, and swung like crazed. Knowing I was a lot heavier than the beast, I felt quite safe. Yet no matter how wild I went, I could't match its growing ferocity. And I didn't possess fangs, as much as I'd love to. The monster managed to grab a hold of my coat, pulling and jerking, trying to throw me off balance. In vain. As I suspected, the poor famished dog simply didn't have enough weight on me. After what looked like a moment, but probably took a good few minutes of a heated do-or-die skirmish, the bough crashed into the dog's bottom jaw, falling apart.

All of a sudden, I had no weapon in my hands but a piece of snapped wood. Thank you, father. For not allowing me to bring a proper weapon with me on a mission that's all about slaying demons. Seems like a good and well-reasoned idea to me. But...

There was no fuss. No more grunts, snarls, biting fangs. Nothing. The poor beast was dead.

Damn, that one hit him on the button. A truly loveable puppy, motionless in the mud, rotting from inside. Every last bit of me wanted to investigate what this thing actually was, by what kind of arcane curse it was befallen. Reading books is one thing, but messing with the subject in person, or rather in dog, is a whole another level. No time for that, though. I could only imagine what horrors might have been happening in the town ahead right now.

I could hear faint, distant sounds of commotion, bearing on from the town. Must make haste, save the day, win the ladies. Maybe there'd be some time to examine the beast later, but now it was time to leave the scene of romance, I guessed.

As I walked forward, and the adrenaline rush settled down, my elbow started to thump with pain. The skinny bastard scratched me hard. Observing the wound and twisting my arm around, I realized it was nothing to scoff at. Pretty deep cut. A wonderful thing was that I had nothing to mend it with.

As I pondered about the hardships of my life, a grave siren echoed across the fields. It came from the town, no mistake. It was safe to assume it meant they were under attack. Trot ahead then, demon hunter, lives need saving!

When the siren faded away into the rain, the sound of raindrops, pounding on my hat, got loud again. Heavy, unceasing thumps. I might have as well used my higgs as a cup. Drinking regime is serious business!





# Town Gate

Reaching the outskirts, I approached a gate. Large, iron, heavy gate. Wonderful work if you ask me. Solid and imposing. With a shiny star at the center above the arch. That was Starham's sigil. People here believed they had come from the stars. Or rather that their ancestors had. No time for history now, even though this town's genesis was quite intriguing. Maybe later.

Below the frame lay a few guards, breathless. Resting in the mud at a time like this, with doors agape and demons abound somewhere near, that was a flagrant irresponsibility, my friends! I knew, you couldn't hear me any more. You gave your lives away, protecting... yourselves, in the first place, I guess. But still, your bravery would echo across the centur...

Wait. What was it glistening in the fen? I'd be damned! A fine dagger! Just for me. You wouldn't mind me taking it, guardsman Ripped, would you?

Hmmm. Okay, so not as fine as it seemed at first sight. Actually, quite the opposite. Though I was still glad I had something sharp in my hands now. Better than those dirty uncut fingernails of mine.

Now that I think of it, demons that overpowered those lads don't use weapons. Not man's weapons, at least. I wonder who, or rather what they were. Somehow I was under the impression that I would find out soon enough. And something told me it wasn't gonna be just kins, like the one slain back there.

Something was amiss, though. If the brutes were insentient enough to leave weapons behind, why was the gate open? <del>did the guards open the gates to fight them?</del> Beasts cannot open gates by themselves, right? So why would the witty sentient guards do? To face big angry demons, quite likely large in numbers, if you can just shush behind a solid, fine gate like this? I, for one, would not. Hell no! If my father heard me now... Or maybe they were no dumb brutes, and they did carry their own weapons. Or the gate was stormed from the other side, and the sentries tried to flee from certain doom. Or the storm came from both sides! Or maybe I was overspeculating. One thing was sure as hell after all -- they seemed to have fled right into the certain doom rather than away from it.

Past the gate, in a web of streets, alleys and small squares, I found myself amidst chaos. A burgess here and there, running for their lives. Others watching from the windows, curious, nervous, with horror in their eyes. Women screamed somewhere beyond acrid smoke, wallowing around. As I closed in on the town center, I saw carts and other stuff smashed to pieces, trails of blood, a mutilated corpse, and more people running away from something.

And then, then I saw that something. A pack of furious kins, tearing some poor soul apart. And a pack leader! It was still a kin, only much larger. Dogs infused with demonic blood. Running through their veins, burning in their eyes. The red tint was unmistakable.

This was going to be hard. Fucking hard. I needed to pick them one by one, so I could face the big one alone. If only I had had a crossbow. I could have ended the misery of a number of them before they'd even know what hit them. Well, I didn't have a crossbow. Just a dagger. And even that, inferior to anything I ever held in my hands. No problemo, though! I was a witchslayer, a chosen assassin of foul beasts, a professional killer, an unmatched fighter of all evils. I had the patent to get out of any situation, no matter how sticky. Or stinky. I was the light in the world of darkness. And so on and so forth. My father's voice playing in my head. Well, what a blast!

He was right in one thing. Lamenting never helps. So let's analyze what I could really do, there and then, with what I had. `Weird sentence.` The books say that kins are dogs and nothing more. With just a little tiny alteration. A drop of demonic blood in their own blood makes them a lot more vicious, aggressive, and relentless. And as it seems, the master of this pack ain't nowhere nearby. They were on their own. They must have invaded the town with a purpose, under a leadership of someone with power. An actual person. But now, that leader was out of sight, and the new one was one of their own. The big brute. Maybe if I slew him quickly, the rest would yield. Nah, doubt it. They would protect the kill with all the ferocity kins are known for. By the way, the kill!

It was... had been, a woman. A fat one. Being torn to meaty chunks, not 60 feet away from me. Fat was a commodity sought after in these times of cold. The dogs knew who to choose. I gave them that. Thing was, they weren't gonna live long enough to savor it, as it was time to avenge the lady.

I moved forward, determined. I hoped I knew what I was doing. Well, by stating that, it's clear beyond doubt that I had no freaking idea what I was doing.

Journeys with father were different. We were well equipped. Had weapons made to tear through demon flesh. Had medicines, simple explosives, the heavenly potion... And we had father! The friggin' Danton Rike, famous as a man can get. I could fight kins with all that. I could even fight one with a stick. But could I beat six of them?

Let's see.





# Demon Dogs

I paced up, getting close, going from a side, from their backs. One of them was a bit isolated and seemed to have dropped its guard. Came in handy! It paid no attention to me. It paid a healthy amount of attention to its snack, though, the arm of the fat lady. I lunged forward and buried the dagger in the kin's back, near its head. It squealed hard from its lungs, fell flat on the belly, but tried to recover immediately. In vain. I imagine what the world must have looked like to this creature. Disorienting, fading, painful. This one was done. No need for more blows.

The rest of the pack noticed me, but they didn't seem to be willing to leave the main kill. My god! The fire! In the big kin's eyes. Burning with hatred and agony. I could see, I could tell the poor beast suffered, yet couldn't push its true will over the dark influence. They stood still now. Upright, as dogs are when they're fully excited about something, only waiting to act.

After my first kill, I felt empowered. But that feeling was shattering quickly, as the stand-off continued. The kins, nervous, jerking, poised to attack any moment. And then, they did! The big one led the charge!

Instincts took over. I watched myself sprinting away, as if in a dream. No control. No feelings. Just action. Instincts are nice, but they don't make you a superhuman sprinter. The brutes quickly caught up, lunging at my back. I turned around and swept the dagger across. The poor whelp, the one most eager to taste my flesh, or the fastest of them all, got cut on the nose. A bad, deep gush, bursting with blood. It rolled to the side, whining, and lost interest in me in an instant.

Another one grabbed a hold of my right hand. That was bad. Because that's where the dagger was. I tried to shake the kin off with all my strength and added fury to the mix. Before I could get anywhere with that endeavor, the big one jumped my chest, sending me tumbling on the cobblestones. I still managed to put the blade into the other hand, and stabbed the grabber two or three times, all the while shielding my face from the grimy fangs of the big fiend. I felt a third dog furiously biting my right feet and leg. Then another one, from behind, trying to join the chieftain in the feast, with my facial features on the menu. Struggling hard, and even harder... No, struggling hardcore! That's the word. Struggling hardcore, I kept stabbing, shoving, kicking, and punching anything I could. I didn't know such a fighting spirit was in me. So much power and determination to live. Well, I guess we all fight like lions when the end is near.

And yes, it was near. No matter how ferocious, I was simply being overpowered. My father would have killed me if I died there. Like that! In the jaws of rabid dogs. I realized then that there was nothing noble in death, nothing poetic. It's just you getting your ass kicked. And then it's over.

My strength began to fade out, I no longer could hold the mongrel out of my face and shrug off the others. As moments passed, I succumbed to the bites and rips. But...

No more bites. No more scratches. They let me be in an instant. A whistle, barely audible, blew through the streets. A long, immersive, chilling sound. They hesitated for a split second, not quite willing to give up another kill, but then stormed off, disappearing in the smoke.

I found myself back on feet, staggering across the street without aim. I took deep, heavy breaths. Everything happened so quickly. The shock began to recede. Yet I was still dazed a bit. Looked at my body, legs and hands, and swept hands over my face. To my huge relief, no new major wounds were added to the toll. Just moments before, I was facing death, surrendering to her affable arms back there on the ground, writhing in agony. And now? Look at me. Barely scratched!

Well, the pain would surely kick in as soon as the rush faded out. That I'd learned earlier that day. So let's not get too joyful about my well-being just yet.

Wait. The kins. They... The whistle. I'd never heard such a sound. The kind that gives you shivers from the crown to the spine, all the way down. So I was wrong about their master being out of picture. I could only wonder. Why had my life been spared? Could be coincidence? Did the master have no knowledge of me and recalled his pets at a wrong time? At the right time, for fuck's sake! Because they were needed elsewhere? Plain, monstrous, unprecedented luck, if that was the case. Or did the master swear by the old saying: "It's too early in the day for killing princes?" And so they left me to breathe another day just to savour the clash later? Yeah, but I was no prince. A demon hunter, sure. That could be seen as something of a prize to slay. But not a known demonslayer yet, not famed through the realm. How would they know? And still, that sounded more like a tale of heroes and villains. Too convoluted. Or, a third option, omnipresent wherever I let my mind ruminate over trifles -- I was simply speculating all too much again!

I chose the third option, for now, and walked back to where they feasted on the fattie. From there, an alley led to the town's centre, the main square.





# Town Center

Guardsmen, this time alive and dressed in shiny... uhm... dressed in ragged armor, duking it out with some more dogs. And...

A new player on the field! Let us see. Small humanoid, hunched, screechy, long misshapen ears. Must have been a changeling. There were two of them! The other one with a torch. These fiends were known to be fond of fire.

I raced through the square. The torchman saw me, and took a battle stance right away. I had no intent on fighting that one head on. A torch in my face? Hell no! With a swift sway of my upper body, I flung the dagger at him. Bullseye, motherfucker! The blade pierced through his cheek, spraying blood into the air. The torch fell first. Then the body. And then the dagger, slipping off the ripped flesh.

Having collected both the blade and the torch, I waded right into the thick of battle. Swinging torch scared the dogs away, and made way to the other changeling. This one had no idea death was coming for him, from behind. I dropped the torch, and approached in a swift but silent move. While he was taunting the guards, and gearing up for an attack, I grabbed his black hair and sliced his throat like a goat. Watching him collapse into the muddy pavement, I began to feel empowered again. And then...

The whistle!

The willies ran down my spine, built up, and then burst in a solid shake. What sound was that? Damn! So outlandish and eerie!

Remaining kins rushed back to their master. Unseen. Unknown. At least to me. I took a moment to assess the situation. And, ladies and gentlemen, it was a mess. All around me. Dead bodies of wry creatures, men, women, pieces of men and pieces of women, burning clothes, trails of blood. A stout spillage for sure.

The dust of the battle settled down. And so did the heart rate of all the survivors. If I could still count, I saw 4 men. One of them turned to me, demanding my attention. An old man. Stocky and experienced. That much I could see at a glance.

His firm voice filled the air.

Guardsman:: Thank you, stranger! You surely pack a punch. But who are you? What brings you here in these bad times?

Me:: Rike's the name. I'm here on request by the mayoress.

His eyes glared up, his voice relaxed.

Guardsman:: What a timely arrival! You come any later, and we're goners!

It was a delight that he took notice of my combat prowess, a spectacular display of speed and brutality, and my overall contribution to the fight...

Then, he smirked at me.

Guardsman:: Just kidding! We'd be fine. For who knows how long though. Nah, I'm glad you're here!

Then he scowled, his face turning surprised.

Guardsman:: But wait... You alone? They sent a kid, not the grandpa?!

Me:: Yeah, grandpa has retired. But fear not, I'm his son and I'm as eager to kick some demon ass as he ever was.

Guardsman:: We'll see, youngster, we'll see.

He was disappointed. Saw me as a cheap replacement for a true problem-solver they had sent for -- my father.

Guardsman:: By the way, name's Liam. I'm the chief guard of the Town Watch.

Me:: Well met. So where to find the mayoress?

Liam took a deep breath, his eyes going down, voice turning quiet.

Liam:: She's...

And before he could finish, his eyes went up, staring behind me. Just by looking at his worried face, changing to a horror, I could safely assume what was coming.

// `vyhod tie barikady.. to je uplna blbost.. proste tam nabehlo zopar dalsich monstier`

Liam:: Whoa! The beasts are about to break the barricades! Prepare to fight, men!

Only then did I notice the barricades, obstructing a narrow street, built in a hurry by the looks. How long had this town been under siege? A week? More? If they had to scrap up freaking barricades...

<!-- And how effective a barricade made of random stuff from streets and houses could be against agile dogs and small changelings. -->

Liam's affirming voice echoed through the square.

Liam:: Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run, lads. We take our stand here!

The men braced up. The barricades cracked and crumbled, letting in lots of kins, poison kins, and changelings. Poison kins? Wow! I was getting faster at recognizing demonry at a glance.

Now these slimy whelps known as poison kins are a nasty breed. Even if you slay a hundred of them, a single unfortunate bite can send you under lilies. The ailment they cause is annoying as hell. Deadly if not cured in time. Nausea, diarrhea, and loss of consciousness a few hours later; all these lovely effects guaranteed.

Well, witchslayers can resist these effects with ease. They have the right medicines. Specialized medicines, oitments, wardstones... They do. But I didn't! Cause why the hell would I carry any gear with me to a town besieged by demons, right?

As a bonus, poison kins also tend to be a little stronger than regular kins. And we were about to get a taste of that, as they rushed towards us. Some of the large-eared demons carried sickles and more torches.

Liam:: Brace yourselves!

We fended off the first wave of the most daring. Without losses. Liam was one hell of a warrior! Damn, that man! Not fast, not agile, or smart in his moves, but that power behind every swing! You could give him a fucking book in his hand, and he'd still smash anyone into the ground with it.

He shattered two beasts, all with a single blow of his blade. And I got none. Was probably too amazed by his combat prowess to actually get one myself.

Amazing as he was, I was gonna need to contribute too, with another nasty lot on the rise.

Liam took a brief look at us.

Liam:: Hold the line! Another bunch coming!

His voice commanded respect and gave you courage, the will and the urge to fight for him. Something only a natural leader possesses. Or maybe I was young and naive, and still believed in such stuff. The heroic duty to fight for another man...

Oh wait, we're at battle! No time to ruminate. All the more because this time, there were one too many of them, surrounding us, lunging from all sides. We formed a circle, repelling, parrying, and slicing as we could.

When the odds began to feel unbearable, Liam commanded to retreat and regroup several yards further up the square. We took a stand near some piles of rubble, decreasing the angle from which they could attack.

I buried, engraved, and inscribed my dagger in as many fucklings as reachable. I was an artist now, flesh the canvas, dagger the brush.

A head rolled in front of me. Human's head! I looked at Liam. He looked to his side. One of the guards just lost his head. Not to a woman, but a sickle! How did that little shit of a changeling manage to swing so high?

Liam was quick to retaliate, creating two halves of that bitch in a brutal squelching blow with his sword.

Losing a man when surrounded like this was not very affirming, let me tell you that! But wait. There were not many mishaps left, really.

Liam interrupted my premature relief.

Liam:: Looks like the last bunch. Keep it up, lads!

Oh well, there were more! Not as many as before, but the poison kins were finally joining up the party, making the fight tricky. Contracting kin disease is no joke. My or anyone's life could end in a single bite that is deep enough.

I kept painting with the blade, adding some texture with the torch the halved changeling left on the ground. The smell of burned skin filled the air.

But let's talk a little about the painting with the dagger. It delivered, it did. But the service was on par with the class. It was more like nagging and sawing than slicing up clean cuts. It wasn't that bad ten kills ago, but the blade's condition was deteriorating rather fast. If I was to slay ten more demons, I was gonna have to steal a sickle.

I managed to put the blunt blade through a small kin's eye. Which, in itself, was a nice artistic touch. Problem was the beastling broke loose, whining like a lil' puppy, with the dagger still in his skull! Made me kinda useless, with now only the torch for weapon.

Dust gathered quickly as the skirmish went on. It was getting difficult, if not impossible to see who's who. Actually, it was difficult to see at all! The fire-stick wasn't helping much either. Then...

Heard a growl right at my back. In a split second, I was facing the slime-covered helldog, him lunging right at my neck! My legs sprung like sprinter's on a battle drug, jumping to the side. I did evade the attack, but a few drops of his spit dropped on my chest, searing the coat. For a moment, I lost track of the dog. Putting the torch in front of me like a ward didn't make me feel any safer. The ordinary kins were scared of fire, but this one couldn't give less of a fuck. And then he attacked again!

I didn't see him; only heard him snarling. Pointing the torch in the direction of the sound was my only option. And I did just that. Then I felt an impact! The kin, sorta, impaled himself on the stick, swallowing the flames! Only then did I see how big he was. And so was his suffering, as he choked on the stick, fleeing like a... well, a whipped dog.

What can I say? Got lucky. Plenty lucky! Father used to say, "Son, sometimes, it's plain dumb luck that gets you through it. But never sell yourself cheaply! Make you look good. Epicly good!"

A quick check proved the spit searing superficial, although ruining my shiny outfit. It was over. Only men were talking. No demons left to slay.

Liam:: Hey, that was something with the torch! Never seen anybody fight like that.

Me:: Yeah, thanks! Well, it's a classic move for us witchslayers, you know.

Liam:: Huhmm.

It was the appreciative kind of "huhmm". But I just couldn't shake off the feeling in my chest. Why was I such a fake...

Me:: So you saw that?

Liam:: Yeah. Saw someone in the dust, duking it out with a dog. Knew it was you. None of my guys moves like that. Now come!

As the dust settled, everyone was taking deep breaths, tired and covered in blood and sweat. All the hell spawn was lying motionless, hacked, slashed, and hunted down, to the last one.

Liam patted me on my shoulder. So gently that I swayed, almost losing ground.

Liam:: Well fought, young Rike! Sorry for doubting you before. You did well, for such a youngster! Really well!

Me:: You did well, too, for such an oldster. But let's not get distracted by this little skirmish. Back to mayoress...

Sometimes, I was surprised myself how quick I was to close a topic, and go on to whatever I found important at that moment. And that realization tended to come only after I had already yapped out another pearl from my mouth. Being in an absolute awe of Liam's fighting power, and giving him no credit for that afterwards, when it was due, was so typical for me. So, fucking, typical! It's like I was afraid to show admiration. Like it weakened me, admitting that someone is just better, stronger, faster, or smarter. I knew why my mind worked like this. My mother required perfection. She only gave me love when I earned it. So I had to be the best. It was not healthy to be under constant pressure to prove your worth. Especially to your parents. But hey, that was my life.

I made my mind. I was going to tell Liam that I admired his fighting. Simple as that. But, you know, on the other hand, my remarks had a style to them. Didn't wanna lose all that macho-don't-give-a-damn charm either.

Liam saddened again.

Liam:: Gilda died two days ago, in a raid like this. Couldn't even bury her. The beasts tore her up, and took her body away with them.

Me:: Well, at least she rests in peace now.

Liam:: More like in pieces now!

Man! Not only powerful as seven horses, good humor too! I was beginning to like this oldie.

I put my hat down, shook the water off, then put it back on. Uhmm. Nope. No water shaken off. The higgs was soaked to the thread. Just as was the rest of my clothes.

//Just the same old water-soaked higgs.

Me:: So, with the mayoress gone, who's in charge now? Who do I report to?

Liam:: Seems like I'm the one. At least until the knights come. But I'll do everything to protect Starham.

I knew who Liam meant. The Knights of Illintar, the protectors of these lands. I guess you understand by now that "protectors" meant "ultimate assholes". There were three major orders of knights, each with a distinct set of rules, training, and prestige. Their task was to patrol the lands, protect and help the population of Illintar. Even more so Starham at the very heart of the region. For those services, people were required to pay in goods and coin. And as rumor had it, commons were often getting the short end of the bargain. Nevertheless, common folks looked upon to them with awe. At least the stupid ones.

Standing there in the heart of a defenseless town, I was quite amazed about the lack of Knights' involvement. That they feared the unknown, diabolical creations of hell, that was understandable. Still, one would expect them to provide basic protection, sanitation, assistance, whatever. Not that they would just roll over a horde of demons. That'd make me jobless, right? But zero care?

Me:: Yeah, about the knights... What's the deal?

Liam:: Well, we have three orders of knights, each with their...

Me:: Yeah, I know that. I did my reading up on you folks before setting out. My question is, why ain't they here?

Liam:: Things ain't what they used to be. Once, it was a privilege and great pride to be accepted into one of the orders. It was religious, traditional, majestic. Now, it's all about politics and family ties. All the glare is just for the show. I wouldn't know, was it not for my cousin. He serves in the Order of the Moon. Dropped by in the winter and told us everything. I'd be as naive as anybody.

Me:: What a mess!

Liam:: And some even say there's so much discord among and inside the orders that the whole thing will just crumble. Everyone fends for themselves.

Me:: That explains! I guess it's safe to assume Knights are out of the equation.

Liam:: Out of what?

Me:: Equation. Means we can't rely on them in any way.

Liam:: Ye, maybe that's why Gilda sent for a witchslayer. Don't you think?

Me:: Makes sense.

Liam:: But... Where's your gear? That palette-knife is all you got? No offense, but that ain't gonna cut it.

Me:: Certainly did so far.

Liam took that as a bad joke.

Me:: Don't worry, I'll manage. I'm Rike!

Liam:: Yeah. You know, Rike's not a popular name in this ditch.

Me:: You still called for one.

Liam:: I didn't. Gilda did.

He grabbed my arm. The coat crackled under the pressure.

Liam:: Listen! Forget about it. I don't mean no offense. It's just I'm worried, is all. See, folks don't like your kind around. And Rike's got a history in this town. Not a nice one. But we ain't stupid. He's the best and he's just 3 days away. Choice was easy. You know, he comes, rids us of this curse, and what you know? Might even become a hero. All bad blood forgotten in a day. But instead, old man sends his boy, with a bent knife in his hand. Gotta understand, that don't make me feel much better.

I didn't take doubts easy. They hurt. All that distrust, all those years. Still, most people thought I was unmoved by them. They didn't know what was inside, in my soul. But I was a good actor.

Action is the best cure to all the pain in your heart. That I learned.

Me:: Ya, so let's get to work. You can doubt me as much as you want, but I'm still gonna deliver.

Liam:: At least you confident. And there's some fight in you. So what you need?

Me:: A few things. Contract, warm place to sleep, something to eat, and as much information as...

Liam:: Whoa, whoa, wait! One at a time. Can't remember everything. You younglings babble so fast! Who's to follow?

Me:: Okay. Let's start with the contract.

Liam:: Uh?

Me:: The contract. You know, I don't work for thanks and handshakes. And since mayoress Gilda ain't around any more, you gotta do it.

Liam:: Yeah, but, uhm... Okay. Here's the thing. I can't write.

Me:: It's okay. A cross will do.

Liam:: Listen. I'm here, right in front of you. Just talk to me and it's done.

Me:: No, doesn't work like that. You gotta sign.

Liam frowned, looking like a kid you force to do something he hates, and took me to Gilda's office. I pulled the scroll out of my coat on a table. The paper was a little dampish, but otherwise unscathed.

Liam:: What? 20 crowns?! Is that what Gilda sent you?

Me:: Yes.

The old man put a cross on the scroll with his burly, cumbrous hands, shaking his head. A grin on his face gave away that he hated every moment of it.

Don't know why the illiterate were so repulsed when required to write. Almost looked like it offended them. Not like I was ever making fun of them for that. Fucking dupes!

Liam:: Can see why peoples hate you.

Hah, now this offended me! These dumbwits don't realize what's in stake, what expertise is required, how skilled you gotta be to outsmart and outplay them fiends. The pay was underpriced by our standards. Typically, we would get to the place and negotiate for more. I wasn't feeling like negotiating. Didn't even cross my mind. But Liam had no clue. A jolly activity like killing monsters couldn't cost more than a piece of bread, right? These people never gave it any thought.

But I kept shut. No use arguing with an old grump.

Liam:: Here. But I'll pay you when the job's done!

Me:: Yeah. That's what the contract says. We take the coin when we're done.

Liam:: Okay. What now?

Me:: I'm hungry, thirsty, soaked to the bone, and I need resting.

Liam:: Yeah, sure, I'll have you housed, but... Think they ain't coming back tonight?

Me:: They are coming back. Not sure when though. Got enough men to keep watch?

Liam:: Got enough of nothing!

//- LiaMe: I'll need you to find the source of this... this madness.

//- Me: Any clues where to begin?

//- LiaMe: Hold your horses. First, we must rebuild defenses to make sure it's safe in the town.

//- Me: Rebuild? Did this town ever have any defensive structures? Or you mean those clumsy heaps of random stuff you call barricades?

//- LiaMe: Uhm, yeah... Okay, we need to *build* defenses. Something from ground up.

//- Me: What do you have in mind?

//- LiaMe: I don't. I'm a warrior, not an engineer. But Builder Francis knows what to do. Go see him, and make yourself useful to whatever needs be.

//- Me: All right. But first, I need you to sign the contract.

//- Danton pride za Marcusom, prebehne dialoga.


//- Man: Hey, sonny!

//- Me: Father?

//- Danton Rike: I couldn't just sit at home, knowing what you're facing here.

//- Me: Nice of you.

//- Danton: I'm so glad you're here, alive and well.

//- I looked into the ground, and said nothing.

//- Danton: What's the matter? Did I do you wrong?

//- Me: Gravedigger told me about Lora and you.

//- Danton: He did, huh? Does he know anything?

//- Me: Seems to know a lot, actually! And I'm not happy with what I've heard.

//- Danton: Well, he beat me to it.

//- Me: Beat you to what, telling me the truth?

//- Danton: Exactly.

//- Me: You're making this up.

//- Danton: Do I? You think I pomliazdil my old bones coming here just to say hi?

//- Me: I don't know. No, you wouldn't do that. So...?

//- Danton: Listen, we need to talk. Someplace warm.

//- He took me to Dawn Inn, his favorite place in Starham. The meal was good and pleasing, and lit me up. Just enough to open to hear his story out.

//- Danton: You told me several times how you felt uneasy around your mother.

//- Me: Yeah. Sometimes she was like behind a mirror. So distant and cold.

//- Danton: I told you how I met her here, how I married her and that. Now it's time for you to know the truth. I came here to tell you.

//- Me: You already said that. But truth about what?

//- **Danton:** About your mother. I met her here, yeah, but not at a marketplace, not on a sunny day. Marcus, she was a witch. Lora was a witch. Quite a strong one. Not the grand-witch level, but still...

//- Couldn't believe what was coming from his mouth.

//- **Danton:** I was quite young back then. And they called for me to get rid of her for the town. So I came to do the dirty job. Job that, I don't know, no one was willing to or brave enough to do. What would have normally been a matter of an hour -- you know, just get there, slay the bitch, bless the place, the people, enjoy the evening, and head back home the next morning -- this time it was different. She was young and beautiful. Very beautiful. She had the innocence of a girl, but fully bloomed like a woman. Not often are these wretched people that beautiful. I'd never seen anyone like that. Well, to this day I haven't. And, in the few hours I spent with her, what should have been a slaughter was a romance. I fell in love with her. She didn't do anything. Didn't try seducing me or anything. Didn't attack me, didn't resist me. I just saw the bright side, the pure human soul in her. The poor, helpless girl under the burden of the curse. And I felt so empowered! When you see a damsel in distress, it's like a switch! It just happens and you're acting on instincts, with little to no thinking. Right? So I tried something. Something that is normally only done by a party of at least three-four master-slayers and usually one grand-slayer. Something that shouldn't have been my call. I tried to cleanse her. And I did.

//- My father did some wicked stuff on his quests that I assisted. Sometimes, it's hard to avoid taking nasty measures to your goals when you're dealing with witches, demons, and other plain-evil wretches. But this? This was too much even for Danton Rike, the baddest witchslayer out there.

//- **Danton:** I claimed she had been cleansed and was now fine and all that. The populace of Starham wasn't happy. At all, to say the least! Some believed she baffled my mind and overpowered me. Took control and all that bullshit. Now you have a picture why I don't travel to this town. They don't wanna see me around.

//- Me: I see. But you're here now.

//- **Danton:** Yeah. Only because I came to warn you.

//- Me: Of what?

//- **Danton:** Lemme just finish the little story I have going on here. I took Lora with me, back to our estate. I married her and had kids. Had you. Everything was fine. Everything, but not everything. I knew I had failed the cleansing ritual. I knew it worked, to a degree, but she wasn't purified. The curse was there, deep inside, hidden and locked away. Lora and I tried very hard to keep it under control, contained. She did a great job! All those years! For that, she had to sacrifice a big part of herself, her personality. That's why she was so cold, emotionless, and heartless at times. You gotta understand, Marcus.

//- Me: Wait. You say these rituals, you know, to cleanse the curse in a witch, require some bigshots in the field, right? So why didn't you do that? And why aren't we doing it, anyway? Why just slay all these people? Some of them got cursed against their will, I'm pretty sure. They want to live a normal, healthy happy life, huh?

//- **Danton:** It's about logistics, cost, and time. It's very difficult to get all these masters and grandmasters to a single place. Get them there in time, before the subject becomes too violent, dangerous, and that stuff. Very expensive to arrange for such a meeting. It's often way simpler to just slay the poor soul, and get on with it.

//- Me: Well, okay, but mother had this curse for many years. And you certainly had enough money to arrange for that. So why didn't you?

//- **Danton:** I did. I tried to make it happen many times. The masters of this art, of this fucking living of ours, they said, "You can be very happy to even be regarded as witchslayer. Very few people know what you did to Lora in Starham. And these people decided to give you a pass. But you will not receive help in any of this! It makes you two things. One, you're a rule-breaker, and should be banished and punished. On the other hand, two, living with a witch makes you very unique and very good. The best far and wide, for sure." That's what they say, anyway. I don't think I'm that good.

//- Me: You are, father! You are!

//- **Danton:** And I'm not! Obviously I'm not if I can't save a woman. A woman I love from my heart! It was getting worse, getting ever more difficult to keep contained. Her health was in decline because of the brutal struggle she had inside her. I had two choices. Let her fight it until her health breaks or set her free.

//- Me: Set her free?

//- **Danton:** Marcus, I could not watch her fading away in my arms, day by day, losing power and will to live. I set her free!

//- Me: Set her free how?

//- Danton: I let her go.

//- Me: You're not talking about the other side, are you?

//- Danton: No, Marcus. I let her walk away.

//- Me: But, there was a funeral. You said... everyone said, the sickness got her. Set her free how?

//- **Danton:** Yes, there was a funeral. There were guests and all. Lora and I, we put on a show. We put her in a coffin and locked her in the family tomb. But she was alive. I promised to free her. At night, I went down there, opened the tomb, let her go. She ran away to the fields.

//- Me: So my mother lives!

//- **Danton:** Yes, but not as a woman. She succumbed to the curse once again! This time for good. She's weak, out there somewhere, but she's free. She could have never manifested her full potential. Ahh, it's so difficult to explain! I love her so much that I want her to be free, even if it means for her to be a witch!

//- Me: I always knew something wasn't right about her. Something creepy, but too dark to even think of.

//- **Danton:** Yeah.

//- Me: So that's the story?

//- **Danton:** That's the story.

//- Me: Hell of a story, father. I'm shaking. But you said you came to warn me. Of what again?

//- **Danton:** Marcus, the powers you're dealing with here in Starham, they belong to Lora! They originate from her!

//- Me: How? She... You said she was weak.

//- **Danton:** Weak, but getting stronger every day. Or night, I should say. I also said she was a powerful creature back then. So even in a weak state, she's still pretty formidable. Also let's not forget that she's a unique case. The curse has been burning inside her for many years! We don't know what that's going to do to her now that she's free.

//- Me: So, my mission just changed from slaying some random bitch to killing my very own mother.

//- **Danton:** Listen, Marcus. I have all the confidence in you, I have no doubts about your abilities to do the job. Any job. You're trained, hardened, and knowledgeable. I know you can take down any miserable beast out there. The only thing that worries me... When you meet her in the flesh, when you see her face and know it's your mother, will you pull the trigger?

//- Me: We're talking about mother here, for fuck's sake! How can you...

//- **Danton:** I know! It's tearing my heart apart! I love her with all my heart, with all my soul. But I also love you! All of you. All my children. Was it not for you, my kids, I would have had nothing to live for any more. Nothing at all. But you are here, healthy, and strong, and beautiful. She's cursed! You're not! I want you to live! And I want her to live, too! But I can't save her! She cannot be saved! So, with all that said, the question is still the same.

//- Me: Will I pull the trigger?

//- **Danton:** Yeah.

//- Me: Why did you even send me here? You must have known from the start it was her. Why, father, why?

//- **Danton:** Because I could not kill her myself! I could not force myself to do it. Not ever.

//- Me: Oh. So you sent your boy to. And that seems about right to you. To send a son to put a bullet in his mother.

//- **Danton:** I had no other choice. I know you're gonna hate me for this till the end of days. But I had no other choice.

//- Me: How about send someone else? Someone outside the family. Someone truly good. Did that even cross your mind?

//- **Danton:** This must be resolved by us! No one else can and no one else will! If I called for a witchslayer from outside, they would, indeed, send some. One to slay the witch, and a dozen more to torch the family estate to the ground, with us inside! This is a dangerous field of work, Marcus. There're rules. Harsh rules!

//- Me: Uh-uh. Slay mother to save family. I see.

//- Marcus just walks away, with no emotion in his face. Just a bland stoic look in his eyes.

//- -----**Danton:** No. I'd never done that. You gotta trust me on this, Marcus! I only realized three days ago. I took to the road right that moment. To warn you. That you will face an enemy unlike any other you've fought and slain over the years.-----



//- ...

//- I: "How can I help?"

//- # Helping Business

//- ...

//- ----

//- Liam: "There are important steps we need to take. But first, rest a bit, take a look around, see if others need help, too, and when you're ready, come to me and I will have work for you."

//- ask Liam about who's in charge here. i know it should be illintar knights, so why don't they fix the demonic problem?


//- i overhear some civilians say dark things

//-     Adults:
//-         "Not this curse again! I wish my children never had to go through such hard times."
//-         "Such a young boy. How can you help us get rid of this witchery..."
//-         "We called for a witchslayer. They sent a boy. Good lord..."
//-         "Lovely Starham, besieged by demons again. Have our ancestors not suffered enough?"
//-         "Liam's rations are too strict. How can we survive on empty bellies?"
//-         "This place is creepy. Strange sounds at night. Shadows around corners..."
//-         "Maggie's right. The witch is back!"
//-     Kids:
//-         "Where's my mommy? She was just here."
//-         "Have you seen the monster, mister?"
//-         "I saw it, I saw it, I saw it! It's real!"
//-         "Father says you no good. Too weak. Go away."

//-  There are four people that have quests for me:

//-     Liam. Starham chief. Has main quests that must be completed to progress.
//-     Boyan. Attack archetype. Has lost his family relic weapon to demons during an assault on the town. Wants to strike a newly formed cult.
//-     Maggie. Prowess archetype. Local seeress, magician. Has some insight into the witchery around Starham. She wants to clean the town's well water from poison and prepare a remedy for sick people.
//-     Godric. Defence archetype. Liam's right hand. Trains guards, takes care of patrols, rations, defensive works. Has quests regarding the safety of the town.

//- Boyan, Maggie and Godric each despises the other two, assuring me that their chosen archetype is the only one to follow.

//- After I complete the quest Source of Evil for Liam, the civilians change their replies to more positive ones.




//- do Starhamu pride Church Warden, bojovny vyslanec cirkvi (the Church), aby presetril dianie. vznikne konflikt medzi Marcusom a nim. Marcus mu povie o kulte v tom lese severozapadne od mesta.. ze to su skutocni kultisti.

//- The Church was aggressively pushing their agenda. Witchslayers were heretics in its strict eyes. Heretics using pagan rituals to cast away bad spirits.  They made up stories about the order, painting us as blood-drinking cultists who fornicate with demons in sadistic orgies. And it worked, to a degree. Simple people will believe just about anything. You only need to feed them the lies over and over and over until you bash it into their little heads.

//- The Church was getting the upper hand. They were gaining new members in a rather worrying pace. Folks need security. Something they can rely on, and cling to. And many felt little to no purpose in their lives. The Church gave them one. To worship a new deity -- the all-knowing and almighty God, the protector of the poor, the savior of the common.

//- The old gods faded in the new, ever-present tales of His greatness, preached by the clergy. The most zealous of followers were given a chance to enter the ranks of the Church. They could choose one of several branches. Some sought the spiritual side while others preferred armed forces. Priests preached to masses, inquisitors made sure strict laws were abided, and church wardens enforced the new belief with sword and fire, spreading a an unlikely mix of terror and hope.

//- Danton pride za Marcusom, prebehne dialoga.

//- D: Marcus, listen, we need to talk. I'm so glad you're here, alive and well. You told me several times how you felt uneasy around your mother.

//- M: Yeah. Sometimes she was like behind a mirror. So distant and cold.

//- D: I told you how I met her here, how I married her and that. Now it's time for you to know the truth. I came here to tell you.

//- M: Truth about what?

//- D: About your mother. I met her here, yeah, but not at a marketplace, not on a sunny day. Marcus, she was a witch. Lora was a witch. Quite a strong one. Not the grand-witch level, but still... I was quite young back then. And they called for me to get rid of her for the town. So I came to do the dirty job. Job that, I don't know, no one was willing to or brave enough to do. What would have normally been a matter of an hour -- you know, just get there, slay the bitch, bless the place and the people, enjoy the evening, and head back home the next morning -- this time it was different. She was young and beautiful. Very beautiful. She had the innocence of a girl, but was fully bloomed like a woman. Not often are these wretched people that beautiful. I'd never seen anyone like that. Well, to this day I haven't. And, in the few hours I spent with her, what should have been a slaughter was a romance. I fell in love with her. She didn't do anything. Didn't try seducing me or anything. Didn't attack me, didn't resist me. I just saw the bright side, the pure human soul in her. The poor, helpless girl under the burden of the curse. And I felt so empowered! When you see a damsel in distress, it's like a switch! It just happens and you're acting on instincts, with little to no thinking. Right? So I tried something. Something that is normally only done by a party of at least three-four master-slayers and usually one grand-slayer. I tried to cleanse her. And I did. I claimed she had been cleansed and was fine and all that. The populace of Starham wasn't happy. At all, to say the least! Some believed she baffled my mind and overpowered me. Took control and all that bullshit. Now you have a picture why I don't travel to this town.

//- M: I see. But you're here now.

//- D: Yeah. Only because I came to warn you.

//- M: Of what?

//- D: Lemme just finish the little story I have going on here. I took Lora with me, back to our estate, I married her, had kids. Everything was fine. Everything, but not everything. I knew I had failed the cleansing ritual. I knew it worked, to a degree, but she wasn't purified. The curse was there, deep inside, hidden and locked away. Lora and I tried very hard to keep it under control, contained. She did a great job! All those years! For that, she had to sacrifice a big part of her personality. That's why she was so cold, emotionless, and heartless at times. You gotta understand, Marcus.

//- M: Wait. You say these rituals, you know, to cleanse the curse in a witch, require some bigshots in the field, right? So why didn't you do that? And why aren't we doing it, anyway? Why just slay all these people? Some of them got cursed against their will, I'm pretty sure. They want to live a normal, healthy happy life, huh?

//- D: It's about logistics, cost, and time. It's very difficult to get all these masters and grandmasters to a single place. Get them there in time, before the subject becomes too violent, dangerous, and that stuff. Very expensive to arrange for such a meeting. It's often way simpler to just slay the poor soul and get on with it.

//- M: Well, okay, but mother had this curse for many years. And you certainly had enough money to arrange for that. So why didn't you?

//- D: I did. I tried to make it happen many times. The masters of this art, of this fucking living of ours, they said, 'You can be very happy to even be regarded as a witchslayer. Very few people know what you did to Lora in Starham. And these people decided to give you a pass. But you will not receive help in any of this! It makes you two things, Danton Rike. One, you're a rule-breaker and should be banished and punished. On the other hand, two, living with a witch makes you very unique and very good. The best far and wide, for sure.' That's what they say, anyway. I don't think I'm that good.

//- M: You are, father! You are!

//- D: And I'm not! Obviously I'm not if I can't save a woman. It was getting worse, getting ever more difficult to keep contained. Her health was in decline because of the brutal struggle she had inside her. I had two choices. Let her fight it until her health breaks or set her free.

//- M: Set her free?

//- D: Marcus, I could not watch her fading away in my arms, day by day, losing power and will to live. I set her free!

//- M: But, there was a funeral. You said, everyone said the sickness got her. Set her free how?

//- D: Yes, there was a funeral. There were guests and all. Lora and I, we put on a show. We put her in a coffin and locked her in the family tomb. But she was alive. I promised to free her. At night, I went down there, opened the tomb, let her go. She ran away to the fields.

//- M: So my mother lives!

//- D: Yes, but not as a woman. She succumbed to the curse once again! This time for good. She's weak, out there somewhere, but she's free. She could have never manifested her full potential. Ahh, it's so difficult to explain! I love her so much that I want her to be free, even if it means for her to be a witch!

//- M: I always knew something wasn't right about her. Something creepy, but too dark to even think of.

//- D: Yeah.

//- M: So that's the story?

//- D: That's the story.

//- M: Hell of a story, father. I'm shaking. But you said you came to warn me. Of what again?

//- D: Marcus, the powers you're dealing with here in Starham, they belong to Lora. They originate from Lora.

//- M: How? She... You said she was weak.

//- D: Weak, but getting stronger every day. Or night, I should say. I also said she'd been a powerful creature back then. So even in a weak state, she's still pretty formidable. Also let's not forget that she's a unique case. The curse has been burning inside her for many years! We don't know what that's going to do to her now that she's free.

//- M: So, my mission just changed from slaying some random bitch to killing my very own mother.

//- D: Listen, Marcus. I have all the confidence in you, I have no doubts about your abilities to do the job. Any job. You're trained, hardened, and knowledgeable. I know you can take down any miserable beast out there. The only thing that worries me... When you meet her in the flesh, when you see her face and know it's your mother, will you pull the trigger?

//- M: We're talking about mother here, for fuck's sake! How can you...

//- D: I know! It's tearing my heart apart! I love her with all my heart, with all my soul. But I also love you! All of you. All my children. Was it not for you, my kids, I would have had nothing to live for any more. Nothing at all. But you are here, healthy and strong and beautiful. She's cursed! You're not! I want you to live! And I want her to live, too! But I can't save her! She cannot be saved! So, with all that said, the question is still the same.

//- M: Will I pull the trigger?

//- D: Yeah.

//- M: Why did you even send me here? You must have known from the start it was her. Why, father, why?

//- D: Because I could not kill her myself! I could not force myself to do it. Not ever.

//- M: Oh. So you sent your boy to. And that seems about right to you. To send a son to put a bullet in his mother.

//- D: I had no other choice. I know you're gonna hate me for this till the end of days. But I had no other choice.

//- M: How about send someone else? Someone outside the family. Someone truly good. Did that even cross your mind?

//- D: This must be resolved by us! No one else can and no one else will! If I called for a witchslayer from outside, they would, indeed, send some. One to slay the witch, and a dozen more to torch the family estate to the ground, with us inside! This is a dangerous field of work, Marcus. It has rules. Harsh rules!

//- M: Uh-uh. Slay mother to save family. I see.

//- Marcus just walks away, with no emotion in his face. Just a bland stoic look in his eyes.

//- -----D: No. I'd never done that. You gotta trust me on this, Marcus! I only realized three days ago. I took to the road right that moment. To warn you. That you will face an enemy unlike any other you've fought and slain over the years.-----








//- preco sa volas witchslayer ked vlastne kilujes demonof

//-     You are a member of a famed family of witchslayers, the Rikes. Family that, for generations, has been hired to slay foul beasts, hunt witches and fend off demon spawn. Your name is Marcus Rike.

//-     Your mother, Lora Rike, died a few weeks ago. The family has not got over the mourning yet and a request of your services came last night. As your old father, Danton Rike, is retiring now, he gives this new assignment to you, his eldest son.

//-     The call for help came from Starham, your mother's birthplace, from the town's mayoress. Increased demonic activity, attacks of foul beasts and strange occurences have been reported. Your father sends you there to investigate. As per tradition of the Rikes, you are sent with no equipment; only your knowledge and training over the years are to help you defeat the hellish infestation.

//-     Danton promises to relegate the family relic, the famous shotgun, The Witchslayer, to you upon your successful mission.
//-     The main surprise of the story is that the witch behind the happenings around and in Starham is in fact your deceased mother. Your father and she had kept a little secret from you, their children. Many years ago, Danton hunted down a witch from Starham and managed to cleanse her of evil spirits. In the process of this battle, he fell in love with her and later married her.

//-     Thing is the demonic side in her never quite died off. But she kept the evil shut down deep inside her all those years. And the spirit suffered hell, having to live side by side a famous and powerful demonslayer. After her mortal death, she was buried in her birthplace, the town of Starham, as was her last will. The evil spirit took a hold of her body and soul once again. When she was exorcized back in the day, they took an immensely powerful artefact from her and knowing its corrupting power, they locked it away down in Starham's treasury, for no one to ever lay hands on it again. She is after it, to regain her former power, revenge her suffering, and more…

//-     Lora the Witch is physically still very weak and needs time to recover. Therefore she corrupts other weaker beasts, or summons demons willing to serve, to do her bidding. First, she tries to overpower Starham's guards by force, sending corrupt beasts and demonic dogs from the nearby forest. You, not knowing it's your mother behind the commotion, foil that plan, as you come to aid.

//-     As you come to Starham, you realize the mayoress who sent the request to the Rikes has been killed in an attack. Liam, the chief guard, takes over and installs a new order.

//-     After the first few quests, Liam tells you that a courier is waiting for you just outside the town gate from where you came. Your father sends you a box and a letter by the courier. In the letter, he explains that this is the end of Act 1, so you can buy the full game (or next act). He also sends a teleportation device, so you can use TP.

//- "No, I'm not asking if you can swim, I'm asking if you do ever swim. Because we all do. Find a quiet lake or pond, and go at it. Every day."

//- "Hmm, fine, but why do you all swim?"

//- "It's very good for your body. Because she does!"

//- My eyes open wide as a thought of the girl going naked into the water flashes through my mind. "Damn! I see what you mean!"

//- "Not sexiest! Sexist." After a slight pause, he adds, "Sexist that you are!"

//- Demon: Yes. All these years, you've been feeding me with souls. I've grown stronger. And so has my appetite!

//- Man: You want me to give you another life? So is that two children now?

//- Demon: Yes, human, that is correct.

//- Man: I know something. A secret. You're not from this world and you are very powerful, yes, but you can still die. You're made of flesh and bones and whatever the fiery liquid that flows through your body. And you bleed, just like anyone else in this world. You might be immortal back there in the place where you came from. But here, you can be gutted like a pig!

//- # Soldier in the Rain

//- An **old man** was sitting on a stump. Slouching in his half-broken armor, soaked as a poor rat, the rain thumping on the rusty bronze glaring in the moonlight.

//- Me: Hey, oldie, what in the living mother of all hells are you doing here in the rain? Need help get you inside?

//- **Man:** I'm telling stories.

//- I looked around for any traces of anything that could possibly listen to a story. None found, as expected. Is this another lost soul in this forsaken county?

//- Me: Stories? To whom?

//- **Man:** To those willing to listen.

//- Me: I wonder what's cracking in that old head of yours. There's nobody here!

//- **Man:** Not now there isn't. There were an hour ago.

//- Me: Oh, okay then. But there's nobody here now.

//- **Man:** I see one.

//- Me: Fair enough.

//- At first, I thought this nightly apparition would hardly talk. To my surprise, he was quite bright. Sitting down on another stump in front of him, I let my usual prejudices go.

//- Me: I'm listening.

//- He didn't speak a word. As if he felt I was not really ready to listen yet. I couldn't help it but ask.

//- Me: Still wondering, though... Tell stories... Why here, in the rain?

//- The man pointed at a sign to his left. It said: "Soldier in the Rain".

//- Me: Oh, fuck me! Didn't see that. Sorry. Gotcha! No, wait. Still doesn't explain why. Why tell stories in the worst weather possible? Is that your style? Or trademark? People go like, "You know that soldier in the rain, musing about tales of yore? Gonna visit him this week. Wonderful lad! And those stories! Creepy as hell! Can't miss!"

//- Soldier in the Rain didn't move a brow. He was just waiting till I'm done with my stupid crap.

//- Me: Sorry. I'm done. Please, tell me a story.

//- **Soldier:** You say this weather is the worst possible. Well, it's a breeze compared to what we endured on the campaigns in the east. But let's start with this. King Marson let us stand in the rain throughout the night, in full armor and camp-moving equipment. Three nights in a row.

//- He reaches forth, gathering water in his palm, looking up into the dark.

//- **Soldier:** Not a rain like this. This is a sprinkle. It was heavy, thick, piss-down!

//- If this dude is for real, I have nothing but amazement for him. I nodded to show him he got my interest now.

//- **Soldier:** You know how it is in the army. If one man fails, the whole company takes the punishment.

//- Me: Oh yeah. To make them angry at the culprit so he'll make extra-double-tripe sure he won't fuck up again.

//- **Soldier:** King Marson had a different approach. He said that if one man fails, it's the fault of the whole army, not just company. So we all stood there, in the field, freezing, three nights in a row. Soaked to the bone! We weren't soldiers. We were toads!

//- I was beginning to feel for this man. Or maybe I only wanted to. I tried to symphatize with him, as bad as I am in that kind of hearty stuff.

//- Me: For the gods, kings are so cruel! And arrogant! I love how Skilley puts it: "Imagine a king who fights his own battles. Wouldn't that be a sight?"

//- **Soldier:** Arrogant, you say? You mean him taking a warm bath, in a nice, dry tent, with a few beauties scrubbing his back. That sort of thing?

//- This guy knew his shit! Was exactly what I had in mind. I nodded.

//- **Soldier:** King Marson stood with us! Every minute of every night! From dusk to dawn!

//- Me: Wow!

//- **Soldier:** Imagine a king who takes the punishment of his own army! Can you imagine how binding that was?

//- Me: I wish I could. Must've been something! I think I'm starting to get all the fascination with rain now.

//- **Soldier:** Men regarded him as a demigod! Some do to this very day.

//- Me: I can tell! And, yeah, you said this little tale was just for starters? But damn, you sure as hell know how to bring drama on the stage!

//- The man felt gratified, I could see that. Didn't think a compliment coming from me would move him. But it did. Or he was a good actor. As he bowed, like they do in the theater, a nasty garbled mess of an ear showed up on his left side. Wasn't really the ear that freaked me out, but rather the lack of it.

//- Me: Oh. That's gross! I mean... unfortunate! A battle rememberance?

//- **Soldier:** A gift from the king himself! You're looking at his last scribe! He told me to write down a message. A direct command. An important one. I garbled it. Misinterpretation. An honest mistake.

//- Me: And this mistake cost lives, right?

//- **Soldier:** No. But still, he said: "You can't hear with it? You don't need it!" And cut my ear off with a knife.

//- Me: I said it! They're cruel!

//- **Soldier:** To you, it's cruelty.

//- Me: To you, it's a gift, yeah, I get it. You soldiers... Crazy bunch!

//- I pointed at his leg. A missing one, mind you!

//- Me: What about the leg? Another gift?

//- **Soldier:** Yeah. From the God of War.

//- Me: You are abnormal!

//- **Soldier:** That's a rare talent you have.

//- Me: Ha?

//- **Soldier:** The ability to notice things.

//- Me: Oh, come on now! Of course it's obvious you're crazy, but mentioning it is not like, "Daaamn, I just discovered the wheel!" It's normal. People do it. Normal people, that is.

//- **Soldier:** Two men sit in the rain, talk about romanticized martial nonsense pre-teen boys dream about, and then one says to the other: "You're abnormal!"

//- Me: Okay. I yield!

//- This man was catching my fancy. In large!

//- Me: So what happened to your leg?

//- **Soldier:** A battle happened. And battles, my friend, are ugly affairs.

//- Me: Yeah, I can see why. But... Even scribes do actual fighting?

//- **Soldier:** With their quill, for the most part. But when needed, they fight like anyone else.

//- Me: Fight and forget limbs on the battefield. I see. But, listen, you're a `kalika`. How do you manage? I mean, what do you live off?

//- **Soldier:** I tell the stories.

//- Me: I see. And people pay for that.

//- **Soldier:** No. Telling them fills me with pride and joy to have served such a man of honor.

//- Me: Wow! I'm typically flat-out cynical, but this one is actually touching.

//- **Soldier:** Yeah? Touching your head, thinking, "What in the living horse is this fool talking about?"

//- Me: No! My sentiment is genuine! I've never met anyone this loyal. Loyal to someone who's long dead, even. It's stupid, and blind, and childish nonsense, as you said. Women say that, too. Even the common sense says that. But to the man's heart, it's poetry.

//- In the moment of spur, or more likely just because I was impressed with my own words, I shook his hand.

//- **Soldier:** Well met, my friend.

//- Me: "What in the living horse," hah. Now that's a new one. Gonna note that.

//- **Soldier:** You're eloquent, too.

//- Me: Jugding by?

//- **Soldier:** Your words.

//- Me: Which?

//- He was looking around as if expecting a visit from hell.

//- **Soldier:** Where?!

//- Me: Ah, no, I don't mean a "witch", you old wit! I mean, "which" words?

//- He laughed from his heart.

//- **Soldier:** I know. Just screwing with you!

//- He blew his nose into the grass, then recessed in thought, as if trying to net something in his memory.

//- **Soldier:** "Style, culprit, fascination, drama, rememberance, abnormal, cynical, sentiment." Not a lot of folks around say these words, or have any clue what they mean. An abomination like "What in the living mother of hells" takes thought. Again, not a lot of folks around capable of a thought.

//- Me: Well, thank you!

//- **Soldier:** Plus, you know a famous remark of a famous man.

//- Me: You mean Skilley?

//- **Soldier:** Yes, him.

//- Me: He's a good guy. A little rough around the edges. But how come you, a soldier, is just as well-spoken?

//- **Soldier:** Who are you looking at again?

//- Me: Oh, right! You're the last scribe of that cruelly honorable king.

//- **Soldier:** Are you pretending to know Skilley, or do you?

//- Me: I've met him once.

//- The soldier's eyes glared with wonderment and anticipation.

//- Me: In a dream!

//- **Soldier:** Hellhorses! You almost got me there.

//- Me: You're looking at a pro at that kind of thing. No, I'm sorry. I'm just rude. But listen. As a compensation, how about we ship out to that lovely tavern over there, buy you a good, warm supper, and a bunch of scoops?

//- **Soldier:** By any means! Now you know what I live off!

//- As we stepped into the cozy place, he stopped me with his hand on my shoulder, a dead-serious face.

//- **Soldier:** Did you really dream about Skilley?

//- Me: Yeah. I did.

//- **Soldier:** Do you dream a lot about soldiers?

//- He grinned, then we bursted out, our laughter echoing through the inn.





//- She was the most athletic human I'd ever known. She had beauty, but no fragrance or sensuality of a woman. There was nothing to embrace, to protect, or to give. Her pretty face and perfect body were something to look at, but I felt no attraction whatsoever. She never needed nor willing to give anything. She was all about perfecting her skill. The embodiment of athleticism. And this is how I killed her.

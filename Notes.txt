postupne sa vojenske idealy odklanaju od sluzby statu (risi), ale skor vznika lojalita ku generalom
generali s mocnou a lojalnou armadou maju velky politicky vplyv.. ich vojaci ich totiz mozu volit vo volbach
a tak sa postupne stat meni v diktaturu najsilnejsieho generala


vojna sa vzdy ospravedlnuje tak, ze je vlastne obranna alebo preventivna.. utocime na nich pre bezpecnost nasho vlastneho statu -- this is how wars are justified

	Marcus Rike is the main hero. He is 26, a highly skilled assassin and fighter with light weapons (daggers, short swords), good archer. He can beat most small demons and human opponents rather easily, but cannot take on experienced fighters willy-nilly. For larger skirmishes, he needs help.

	tajomna postava v ciernom plasti a kapucni.. obcas ti poradi, varuje, vystrasi.. casto miesto neho najdes zrazu havrana.. jakoze vylezies na miesto kde bol a zrazu tam uz neni muz ale havranson

	This is in fact Marcus' older bastard brother Sige Field (38), cast away by their father Danton Rike after Sige proved to be a slow learner of the demonslaying profession. He envied Marcus greatly for being favoured by Danton and Lora Rike. Marcus has no knowledge of having a bastard brother - he was too young when Sige was cast away to remember him. Sige is in a secret demon hunter guild, in his eyes far better and more active than what old Danton does. He plots to kill Danton and destroy his lineage as a revenge for the banishment. He breeds hatred towards Marcus, but shows admiration instead. He pretends to want Marcus in the guild to gain his trust. He uses the fact that Danton and Lora kept a dirty secret from their children to turn Marcus against his family.

	Sige secretly helps Lora the Witch, as she also wants to kill Danton and enslave his soul. That's how he knows so much about things to happen, or things that already happened, but most people cannot know of them so early.

#guild
	The Ether Guild is a group of people who have mastered and run the process of mining, processing and producing ether and various related manufacture. They have quickly become the most powerful guild, known and respected throughout the world. They are a strictly closed community, keeping their secrets of ether working from anyone outside.



#ether
	Ether is a rare substance found in acidic pools in remote caves and forests. With gold, it is the most sought for and valued commodity known to man. There are only a handful of sites where ether is mined or gathered and all are under an iron grip of the Ether Guild. More repositories are believed to exist and yet to be found.

	There are two variants of ether: green and purple.

	Green ether is the more common of the two (albeit still very rare) and is used in 99% of all production.

	Purple ether is also called the "heavenly potion" for its strong mind altering qualities, bringing utmost joy and calmness to the user. After these effects recede, it temporarily increases one's ability to see, hear, think, focus and perform physical activities. On the other hand, it is highly addicting, and due to its general unavailability and high price, it cannot be dosed regularly. Witchslayers and high-ranking assassins purchase this potion to get through difficult situations / missions.

	Ether (mainly green) has a wide use and the resulting essence (and its effects) depends on the combination of other substances mixed in. It is used to produce drugs, cures and poisons. Smiths of the Ether Guild have also learnt to enhance steel and other metals for weapons such as swords, pikes and arrowheads. Enhanced metals tend to have a characteristic green glow, faint and usually only visible in darker conditions; touching such a piece causes tingling sensation. In combat, ether metals (or simply "ether weapons") are very effective; they tend to be lighter than usual weapons and add negative side effects to the wounded. Especially demonspawn seems to suffer greatly. Ether, in the form of a specialized powder, is the only means to produce the trigger mechanism of a firearm - the powder is sometimes called "gunpowder".
